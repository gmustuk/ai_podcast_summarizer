Hello and welcome to Tiny Victories, the show where we offer up minor accomplishments and fleeting joys. I'm Laura House. And I'm Annabel Gerwich. Each week on this show, no matter what kind of week we've all had, we share one thing that gives us a reason to get out of bed. Something we call a tiny victory. That's right. So thanks for joining us. For the next 15 minutes or so, we invite you to hit pause on your anxiety. You should stop worrying about aliens and I'll stop worrying about a low Linda count. And I'll stop worrying about the Lake Tahoe foot fondler. And now let's get tiny. Let's tiny it up. Coming up on the show, embarrassing pastimes. And indulgent free times. All right. So on with the show. All right. I'm bringing a tiny victory to the table. Okay. A couple of them, I think. And that is this was news to me. So sometimes you surprise yourself. Yes. And I surprised myself with a karaoke machine. Oh my God. That's like my nightmare. Tell me. I had been talking in the area with a friend and then I saw one online and then it went on a big fat sale. And I was like, you know what? I don't know why I wanted one in particular. I live with a musician who is also a singer. He's a trumpet player and a singer. I had just watched the Wham documentary. Okay. Your brain was obviously a little adult. Something. Something. And it was just one of those. I one time waited like two years to buy like a CD I wanted like back in the day. So it had kind of been brewing and I was, I pulled the trigger. And my friend Mo Gaffney was visiting when it arrived. And for like two hours we just sang songs and danced in the living room. I can totally picture that. I wish I had a video of that. It was, I don't even want to say delightful. I don't even want to say joyful. I want to say ecstatic. Oh my God. It was ecstatic because first of all, I want you to know, like you're in a choir. I'm a terrible singer. I'm a singer like the, what it sounds like in my head and then what it sounds like in the physical world are very far apart. In my head, I am Madonna. Yes. Lady Gaga. I am not one of those terrible singers who think they're a good singer. I'm a little bit grateful for that. I am a terrible singer who knows she's a terrible singer. But it was just fun. And one of our early episodes, you had talked about hobbies or just things that are fun that you're, you were like the definition of fun or hobby or something was like something you'll never be good at. You'll never make money at two. Like you're never going to get paid to sing. I could possibly get paid if I did a business where people would pay me to stop singing. That's hilarious. If it was like a lemonade stand, but I'm, I'm singing and they were like, I will give you a dollar to stop singing for 10 minutes and I'm great. A dollar for 10 minutes. And then I could, I could probably make a lot of money that way. Okay. First of all, I love that. I mean, it's hilarious that you labored over this karaoke machine purchase. For me, like it's, I have this, what people sometimes call poverty mentality. And sometimes it's so hard for me to like pull the trigger on something that might give me a lot of joy that I could potentially afford, but like, I just can't wrap my head around it. But then the idea that you and Mo did this singing and dancing and as ecstatic, see, like when I hear the story, I think this is like my nightmare because I am deathly afraid of karaoke. I've never done karaoke because I am afraid of sucking in front of people. And I have so much ego bound up in that, that I've never been able to do. And people have fun doing it. I see it. I get it and I have not been able to do it because I have this, this is so embarrassing, crazy magical thinking fantasy that somehow or another, I have a fantastic singing voice, but I don't know it. This is such a fan. I mean, this is really embarrassing. And then people are like, Oh my God, she's 60 years old and like, and, and, and she's this amazing singer and we never knew it and I'm going to be starring on Broadway shows. And like, I just remember Gina Davis, the actress picked up archery at age 40 and then became an Olympian. She competed in the Olympics. How did I not know this? Part of my brain is like, did I know this? I don't know. So like there are these like stories and I, and it's this crazy magical thinking. My boyfriend the other day said to me, I think I could be a great tennis player. And I was like, have you ever played tennis? No, I love it. He's been saying this for two years and I'm like, you still haven't taken a lesson. Have you? No, but I think I could be great. And it's, it's such a funny, weird human thing that from it's all or nothing. And so because of this whole thing though, I never have done karaoke. It's not like you don't want to burst your own bubble. Yeah, it's not like there's ever even a chance of anyone discovering me because I will not sing in front of people. It's like the all or nothing. That's kind of part of the fun fantasy. There's so many things I want to ask for one. Do we think it's an endorphin? Like I get an endorphin and I think like there's times like I'll feel bad about my, my body, my physicality or whatever. And I walk around the block and then I'm like, when, when's the LA marathon? Like I will get like one endorphin and be like, I should, or I'll start on a new program and I'll get kind of excited about whatever a food plan or I'm reading a book or whatever. Maybe I'm going to teach this book. Maybe I'm going to tour the kind of, maybe I'm the new. Yes. Okay. I have a theory about this. This is okay. So that's the thing is maybe I'm the new, that's the fantasy. Maybe I'm the new Bjorn Borg says your boyfriend. I think what it is is it's that we have these sort of like cherished fantasies that are leftover from childhood from the time when you could say, like if you're very young, you could say maybe one day I'm going to be an Olympic gymnast. And holding on to this idea of that gives us happiness and this idea of like a possible future. Oh, I love it. It really depends on doing something that you, you, you don't even haven't even done once. Right. Yes. Pot of boarding field hockey. Maybe. Yes. And it's, there's something it does to our brain. I think, and I think about this and I'm just going to wrap this up as saying, I think about this like when I started writing after careers and actress, I thought maybe I'm going to be like the writer that changes all writing because I hadn't failed at it yet. I love it. And there is something about, we know the ups and downs of the things we've explored and there is something sort of childlike about this totally unexplored. I'm going to make a call right now to like, please call him with your tiny victories or your confessions about your, I'll bet I would be great at this fantasies, please. I want to hear from every listener about your, I actually think I would be a really good Methodist minister or whatever, whatever it is that you think you would be good at that you've never done. Like who didn't watch the bear and like, I kind of want to be a chef even though it looks like the genuinely the hardest thing in the world, but you're like, I know, but when it all comes together, you know, we're like, I'll be in that Copenhagen houseboat and I'll I'll learn the Danish Sunday. And you're like, I'm probably not going to do most of those things. Well, I, and I would, I, and we're going to take a break in a minute so we can hear from another show on the network. But what I love about your little tiny victory, your little tiny, tiny victory is that you went ahead and challenged the fantasy and we're willing to let it go and do the thing that you know, you're not good at and just have a great time. And that is so fun. It was the victory. And I want you to do it again and tape it with you and Mo. Oh, you know what? I was in a song in it. It could have been careless whisper. I don't remember what it was. I would, I was doing it and I saw a look on Mo's face and I turned around and Brian was recording me. So it does, it does exist somewhere. A completely, I do not know. I'm being filmed from behind. I called him a name and I used an expletive and that is, and then he said, Oh, that's perfect. So I think all of that is part of the record as well. Okay. When we come back, we will talk a little bit about indulgent free times. I'm yucky Jessica. I'm Chuck Crudsworth. And this is terrible. A podcast where we talk about things we hate that are awful. Today we're discussing wonderful. A podcast on the Maximum Fun Network. Hosts Rachel and Griffin McElroy, a real life married couple. Yuck. Discuss a wide range of topics. Music, video games, poetry, snacks. But I hate all that stuff. I know you do yucky Jessica. It comes out every Wednesday, the worst day of the week, wherever you download your podcasts. For our next topic, we're talking Fiona, the baby hippo from the Cincinnati Zoo. I hate this little hippo. Welcome back to Tiny Victories. I'm Laura House. And I'm Annabel Gurwitch. So pivoting off of what we were just talking about with, with karaoke, this is kind of a bigger, but related overcoming. All right. We're going to go on vacation, Brian and I. Okay. That's shocking. We've been together six years. For one, we've moved five times in six years. Yes. And we have never taken just a vacation. It's been work related or family related, which is great. And we try to piggyback something that feels, you know, like a, like a vacation. But I, I have been really burnt out and there's a strike. And when, like I'm not able to work and when I am able to work, there's not time to do something. And I don't want anyone to feel bad for me, but that feeling like I don't deserve a vacation goes so deep that it's hard to even talk about right now. Like, oh my gosh. Okay. I just did take a vacation and I am embarrassed to talk about that too. I feel like I just learned how to do this. I mean, I, I'm a freelancer, so I always feel like there's never a time when I travel. I've traveled a lot, but I'm always traveling for work. Self-employed and freelance. You know, my mom was a teacher, there were summers off. You knew when work ended and when you had to be back and you could do whatever you wanted in between. And yeah, when you're a freelance, it's a constant hustle. If you take time, you have to declare it. I mean, you really have to just, I'm deciding that it stops. I'm deciding from this date to this date. There have been times when I've been more flush than other times, but it's really hard. And right now with the strike and all, I felt really guilty that I went. Now, I did work in the mornings and I feel I have to say that when I was in Martha's Vineyard at my friend's house, I feel like I must make sure people know I worked part of the time, but I really did also vacation. And it's really hard for me to even talk about that because I feel like I don't deserve it or I don't want to seem like this kind of person. But mostly it's that I also feel like even saying it out loud is going to, I don't believe in this sort of thing, curse me. It's like a curse. One thing that I've noticed is part of that reluctance to do vacation is I keep moving my own goalpost. So for me, I work in television. So my brain is like, well, if I sell a TV show, then I can take a vacation. And then you sell a TV show and then it's like, well, if it gets on the air, well, if it's on the air for like three years. Well, if it's on the air for three years and then it's in syndication, it's just this insane and then you can go your whole life and you never went to an island or whatever it is. So that was part of what was nice to go, you know what? Today is the day. Yes. I mean, I just feel like I am that person that I want to grind myself into dust before I will take what actually helped me to get more to work better would be if I just took a break. And the thing is, it doesn't have to be the most expensive thing. It's just like actually to just take even a day off. That's really hard. And sometimes it's what you really need. And it's really hard to do that for yourself. Even if it's an hour off, sometimes I just give your brain a break, give your body a break. And if you're fortunate enough to be able to do that. And I mean, again, I do these things with cost in mind. I always want to say that. Oh, always. You know, it's just there's the practical thing of the money and the time. And then there's the actual allowing yourself to a break for a minute. I used to also think if I was what I called the designated worrier in my family. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. It feels like everything will fall apart. Like if you like go like you're holding it all together with your worry, worry that I wasn't allowed to not worry 24 hours a day because someone had to be vigilant about the worry. Someone has to keep that up. Yeah. So I think that's really exciting. And I when you think you we you actually told me because we're going to be we've been doing this little switch of who gets to take a break. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. And I was really happy you said that because I did that and it was really hard for me to do that. And then to see you do that, too. I think it's great. And it's really healthy. And what since I came back from a break, I've been feeling more able to better cultivate the tiny victory frame of mine. Yeah, I think so, too. And so since we're on it, I know we have to wrap up. But so we're going to have a couple of episodes coming up where you're going to have a guest, Laura. Yes. You're going to do some episodes and then we're going to have a couple of reruns. Yeah. And I'm excited. I've got those shows planned out. I'm excited to surprise you when you hear those, Laura. Excellent. And I'm excited for your trip. OK, that is this week's show.
