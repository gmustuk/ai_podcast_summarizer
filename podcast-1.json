I'm your coach, Jim Quick. Hi it's your brain coach Jim Quick with Quick Learning and I'm here as always to help you to learn quickly and I want to talk about your mindset a little bit. In Limitless I talk about the three keys becoming limitless and the first one is the power of your mindset, the attitudes and assumptions you have about things and I want to talk about and have a conversation, a quick conversation with you about effort. You know to get any new result in our life we need to work for it, right? That with practice makes progress and Limitless is not about being perfect, it's about advancing and progressing beyond what you currently believe is possible and part of that mindset is putting in the effort and here's the thing that just putting, it's been my experience teaching this for almost three decades is the people, the difference between individuals and people who really demonstrate this incredible level of genius and I don't mean IQ genius, people who really excel, they put on a little bit more effort. It's not necessarily something really radically huge, it's that little bit more discipline, that little bit more of practice, that little bit more of training, that little bit more of learning that day of serving, going beyond what you currently are doing to put a little bit more and from that guess what, comes an incredible amount of reward. You know there's a book called 212, The Extra Degree and some of you it's a very quick read and the concept is at 211 degrees water is very hot, it is very hot but at 212 degrees it boils and with that boiling comes steam, right? A totally different form of water and that steam can be used to power things like a train, like an incredible locomotive and that's the power of steam by adding one degree you have this incredible power to power this incredible machine and you are a machine, your business is a machine, your brain is a machine. What if you added one extra degree of effort, of discipline, of practice and notice all the different rewards that come from that. If you look at anything we talk about the power of time and be able to do things efficiently and effectively to be able to save that time, right? And when you're thinking about going somewhere you want to first make sure you're going in the right direction because some people can go nowhere fast, right? So make sure you have your target in mind and that you're working efficiently and effectively but if you look at races whether Olympic races or horse races or Indy 500 car races often the difference between winning and not winning is what? A couple of seconds, maybe one second, maybe even a fraction of a second. The difference between a gold medal and no medal at all and what's the difference in reward for somebody who has a gold medal, right? Huge, right? They get to be a hero, they get to be the champion, the best in the world, right? They get all the end or they get all of the rewards and somebody else could be two seconds slower and not see any of those rewards and so that's what I'm talking about, one extra degree. Hi, this is Jim Quick, author of New York Times and Wall Street Journal bestseller Limitless and today I am thrilled to share with you some exciting news. It is Limitless Expanded.

And so I just want to remind you as you're watching this video to think about the areas of your life where you could put one extra degree in your relationship, maybe in your health and wellness, maybe in your physical training. You do that one extra rep, right? And it's interesting because out of doing 10 reps, probably the last one you want to do is the last one, right? The 10th rep and what gives you the most growth? That 10th or that 11th, going that extra one degree. And most people, they just don't put in that extra effort. So I just want to remind you that you have genius inside of you, but to get that change, you have to challenge yourself. And part of being a brain coach or any kind of coach, whether they're coaching you in marketing or in your using your voice or with your finances or your physical body, they want to challenge you. And I want to challenge you as your brain coach to go one more level, that there is another level of you in your focus, in your concentration, in your ability to study. Go a little bit extra in your reading and in your ability to be present with individuals and watch the incredible rewards come back to you. All right? Here's the thing, the bad news, to accomplish anything takes effort. The good news, it doesn't take as much as you think because most people aren't willing to put in that extra effort. So where can you go from 211 to boiling to 12? Where in your life can you really heat things up? We need you right now to not dim your light because it's shining in somebody's eyes. You don't want to reduce and become invisible because you're afraid of what other people are going to think. Instead, be a source of light, set yourself on fire because we have one life, one life. Why aren't we running towards our dreams like we are on fire? So burn brightly, inspire others with your grit and your grace. Help them, encourage them, fan their flame so they could burn brighter because that's what the world needs. In an often dark or dim world, we all could benefit from everybody lighting themselves up. And that's what we want to do today, right? In every single day, train your brain because you train your brain. You transform your brain, you transform your life, right? You change your brain, you change your world. And where does it start? Put in that extra effort. Put in that extra effort. Do not make excuses. Do not take time to complain. That just wastes time, that wastes energy and wastes your focus. Instead, put that extra energy into developing yourself. There is a version of yourself you haven't met yet. And our goal on this journey together is to keep showing up, showing up for yourself, showing up for each other. How do you become limitless in a limited world? We do it together. We have each other's back, right? We're here in, as many of you are in our app and you're meeting each other, you're creating community, you're connecting, right? How do we become limitless? We become limitless together, right? There's this African proverb that says, if you want to go faster, go alone. But if you want to go further, we go together. So together, let's all add one extra degree to today's day. Extra degree of focus, of discipline. Do not shrink your dreams to meet this current situation. Expand one extra degree, your focus, your concentration, your determination, your discipline, your practice, your learning, your study. Do that important work, right? And you will get the rewards.
